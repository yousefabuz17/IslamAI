This du’a also calls upon Allah (swt) using his rightful attributes of being Al-Aziz (the mighty one) and Al-Hakeem (the wise one). The du’a concludes by asking for protection on the day of judgment and asks to receive his mercy which would be the best of all gifts."
59:10,رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلِإِخْوَانِنَا الَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِالْإِيمَانِ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ فِي قُلُوبِنَا غِلًّا لِّلَّذِينَ اٰمَنُوا,"“Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed.”",Rabbanagh fir lanaa wa li ikhwaani nal lazeena sabqoonaa bil eemaani wa laa taj’al fee quloobinaa ghillalil lazeena aamanoo ,A du’a which reflects the attitude we should have for our fellow Muslim brothers and sisters. Those who “preceded us in faith” would refer to those who embraced Islam before the emigration from Makkah to Yathrib. Those who came after would be everyone who accepted Islam after the migration. This du’a is a reminder that we are one Ummah and we should not harbor resentment or hate towards one another. We must continue with love in our hearts for our community and to resist being envious towards any good Allah (swt) may have bestowed on another person.
59:10,رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٞ رَّحِيمٌ,"“Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.”",Rabbannaaa innaka Ra’oofur Raheem,"A du’a of praise using two of Allah’s rightful names and attributes. The first being Ar-Ra’uf meaning the benign one, the one who is extremely kind and compassionate. The second being Ar-Raheem meaning the most merciful, the one who acts with extreme kindness, bestowing mercy upon his creations."
60:4, رَّبَّنَا عَلَيۡكَ تَوَكَّلۡنَا وَإِلَيۡكَ أَنَبۡنَا وَإِلَيۡكَ ٱلۡمَصِيرُ,"“Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned, and to You is the destination.”",Rabbanaa ‘alaika tawakkalnaa wa ilaika anabnaa wa ilaikal maseer,"We must show complete trust and reliance in Allah (swt) for all matters. This du’a is one that affirms that we have relied on Him alone. Furthermore, it is also a prayer of remembrance that this life is only temporary. The final destination is when we return to Allah (swt)."
60:5,رَبَّنَا لَا تَجۡعَلۡنَا فِتۡنَةٗ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَا رَبَّنَآۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُ,"“Our Lord, make us not [objects of] torment for the disbelievers and forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.”",Rabbana laa taj’alnaa fitnatal lillazeena kafaroo waghfir lanaa rabbanaaa innaka antal azeezul hakeem,"Du’a of Prophet Ibrahim (as): This is a du’a Prophet Ibrahim (as) recited asking to make the believers victorious over the disbelievers. To not make us “objects of torment” meaning if the disbelievers won, they would falsely assume what they followed was correct. They would question how Allah (swt) would allow his believers to lose. The du’a then continues referring to Allah (swt) as azeezul hakeem meaning the most powerful and wise."
66:8,رَبَّنَآ أَتۡمِمۡ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَآۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞ,"“Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us. Indeed, You are over all things competent.”",Rabbanaaa atmim lanaa nooranaa waghfir lana innaka ‘alaa kulli shai’in qadeer,"Another beautiful du’a asking for Jannah. We learn in Surah Al-Hadid verse 12 how on the day of judgment the believing men and women will have a light illuminating from their right hands. They will be told “a good tiding for you today.” The hypocrites will find themselves stumbling in darkness. This du’a asks Allah (swt) to perfect or to complete our light on that day and to forgive us our sins. Indeed, Allah (swt) is competent and powerful over all things."
