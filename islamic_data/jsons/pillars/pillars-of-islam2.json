        "These are the foundation of Muslim life and Muslims are required",
        " to observe them with utmost devotion. Just like a building lacks",
        " stability without strong pillars, a believer’s relationship with God lacks focus",
        " without observance of the five pillars. These pillars form the foundation",
        " and starting point for all other good deeds and acts of",
        " worship to God. 1. Faith or belief in the Oneness of",
        " God (Allah) and the finality of the Prophethood of Muhammad, peace",
        " be upon him (pbuh); 2. Establishment of the 5 daily prayers;",
        " 3. Concern for and almsgiving to the needy; 4. Self-purification through",
        " fasting in the month of Ramadan. 5. The pilgrimage to Mecca",
        " for those who are able."
    ],
    "5-Pillars": {
        "1-Faith (Iman)": [
            "“There is none worthy of worship except God (Allah) and Muhammad(pbuh)",
            " is the messenger of God.” This declaration of faith is called",
            " the Shahadah, a simple formula that all the faithful pronounce. The",
            " significance of this declaration is the belief that the only purpose",
            " of life is to serve and obey God, and this is",
            " achieved through the teachings and practices of the Last Prophet, Muhammad",
            " (pbuh)."
        ],
        "2-Prayer (Salah)": [
            "Prayer is the name for the obligatory prayers that are performed",
            " five times a day, and are a direct link between the",
            " worshipper and God. There is no hierarchical authority in Islam and",
            " there are no priests. Prayers are led by a learned person",
            " who knows the Quran and is generally chosen by the congregation.",
            " Prayers are said at dawn, mid-day, late-afternoon, sunset and nightfall, and",
            " thus determine the rhythm of the entire day. These five prescribed",
            " prayers contain verses from the Quran, and are said in Arabic,",
            " the language of the Revelation. Personal supplications, however, can be offered",
            " in one’s own language and at any time. Although it is",
            " preferable to worship together in a mosque, a Muslim may pray",
            " almost anywhere, such as in fields, offices, factories and universities. Oftentimes",
            " visitors to the Muslim world are struck by the centrality of",
            " prayers in daily life."
        ],
        "3-Obligatory Charity (Zakah)": [
            "An important principle of Islam is that everything belongs to God,",
            " and that wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust.",
            " The word zakah means both “purification” and “growth.” Our possessions are",
            " purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need and",
            " for the society in general. Like the pruning of plants, this",
            " cutting back balances and encourages new growth. Each Muslim calculates his",
            " or her own obligatory charity individually. This involves the annual payment",
            " of 2.5% of one’s capital, excluding such items as primary residence,",
            " car and professional tools. An individual may also give as much",
            " as he or she pleases as voluntary charity, and does so",
            " preferably in secret. Such charity is not limited to financial giving.",
            " The Prophet said, “Even meeting your brother with a cheerful face",
            " is an act of charity.” The Prophet also said: “Charity is",
            " a necessity for every Muslim.” He was asked: “What if a",
            " person has nothing?” The Prophet replied: “He should work with his",
            " own hands for his benefit and then give something out of",
            " such earnings in charity.” The Companions of the Prophet asked: “What",
            " if he is not able to work?” The Prophet said: “He",
            " should help the poor and needy.” The Companions further asked: “What",
            " if he cannot do even that?” The Prophet said: “He should",
            " urge others to do good.” The Companions said: “What if he",
            " lacks that also?” The Prophet said: “He should check himself from",
            " doing evil. That is also an act of charity.”"
        ],
        "4-Fasting (Sawm)": [
            "Every year in the month of Ramada-n, all Muslims fast from",
            " dawn until sundown–abstaining from food, drink, and sexual relations with their",
            " spouses. Those who are sick, elderly, or on a journey, and",
            " women who are menstruating, pregnant or nursing, are permitted to break",
            " the fast and make up an equal number of days later",
            " in the year if they are healthy and able. Children begin",
            " to fast (and to observe prayers) from puberty, although many start",
            " earlier. Although fasting is beneficial to health, it is mainly a",
            " method of self-purification and self-restraint. By cutting oneself from worldly comforts,",
            " even for a short time, a fasting person focuses on his",
            " or her purpose in life by constantly being aware of the",
            " presence of God. God states in the Quran: “O you who",
            " believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed to",
            " those before you that you may learn self-restraint.” (Quran 2:183)"
        ],
        "5-Pilgrimage (Hajj)": [
            "The pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) is an obligation only for those",
            " who are physically and financially able to do so. Nevertheless, over",
            " two million people go to Makkah each year from every corner",
            " of the globe providing a unique opportunity for those of different",
            " nations to meet one another. The annual Hajj begins in the",
            " twelfth month of the Islamic lunar year. Pilgrims wear special clothes:",
            " simple garments that strip away distinctions of class and culture, so",
            " that all stand equal before God. The rites of Hajj, which",
            " are of Abrahamic origin, include going around the Kaaba seven times,",
            " and going seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa",
            " as did Hagar (Hajira, Abraham’s wife) during her search for water.",
            " The pilgrims later stand together on the wide plains of Arafat",
            " (a large expanse of desert outside Mecca) and join in prayer",
            " for God’s forgiveness, in what is often thought as a preview",
            " of the Day of Judgment. The close of Hajj is marked",
            " by a festival, the Eid al Adha, which is celebrated with",
            " prayers and the exchange of gifts in Muslim communities everywhere. This",
            " and Eid al Fitr, a festive day celebrating the end of",
            " Ramadan, are the two holidays of the Islamic calendar."
