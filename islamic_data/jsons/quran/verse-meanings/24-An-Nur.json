                " to death for adultery after marriage, applies",
                " only to the Muslims. The most weighty",

                " of enjoying the complete state of ihsan",
                " dces not refrain from committing adultery. The",
                " Arabic word ihsan means \"moral fortification,\" which",
                " has three essential components. First, the man",
                " should be a believer in Allah and",
                " in the accountability after death and should",
                " owe allegiance to Divine Law. Second, he",
                " should be a free member of society",
                " and not a slave of somebody, which",
                " might hinder him from satisfying his desires",
                " in a lawful manner, and his helplessness",
                " and indigence should make him commit a",
                " sin when there is no family to",
                " help him in protecting his morality and",
                " honour. Third, he should be married and",
                " should have the means of statisfying his",
                " sex desires lawfully. Where these three components",
                " exist, the moral fortification would be complete",
                " and anybody who breaks through these three",
                " fortifications for the sake of illicit sex",
                " gratification, would really deserve the extreme penalty",
                " of being stoned to death. But in",
                " a case where the very first and",
                " foremost component of belief in Allah, in",
                " the Hereafter and in Divine Law, dces",
                " not exist, the fortification is not complete,",

                " is not such as to entail the",

                " qazf, the only thing that can save",
                " him from the prescribed punishment is that",
                " he should produce four witnesses who should",
                " give evidence in the court that they",
                " have seen the accused committing zina practically",
                " with such and such a man or",
                " woman. According to the Hanafis, all the",
                " four witnesses should appear at one and",
                " the same time in the court and",
                " they should give evidence all together. For",
                " if they appear one after the other,",
                " each one of them will become a",
                " qazf, and will need four witnesses to",
                " support him. But this is a weak",
                " argument. The correct position is the one",
                " adopted by Imam Shafi`i and `Uthman al-Bani,",
                " that it is immaterial whether the witnesses",
                " appear all together or come one after",
                " the other; it is rather better that",
                " as in other cases the witnesses should",
                " come one after the other and give",
                " evidence. The Hanafis hold that it is",
                " not necessary that the witnesses should be",
                " righteous; even if the qazif produces four",
                " immoral persons as witnesses, he will escape",
                " the prescribed punishment of qazf, and the",
                " accused also the prescribed punishment of zina,",
                " because the witnesses are not righteous. However,",
                " if the qazif produces witnesses who are",
                " unbelieving, or blind, or slave, or those",
                " already convicted of qazf, he will not",
                " escape the punishment. Imam Shafi`i holds that",
                " if the qzif produces witnesses who are",
                " immoral, he and his witnesses, all will",
                " become liable to the prescribed punishment, and",
                " the same is the opinion of Imam",
                " Malik. But the view of the Hanafis",
                " in this matter appears to be nearer",
                " the truth. According to them, if the",
                " witnesses are righteous, the qazif will be",
                " acquitted of the charge of qazf, and",
                " the crime of zina will become established",
                " against the accused. But if the witnesses",
                " are not righteous, the qazif's crime of",
                " qazf, the maqzuf's crime of zina and",
                " the evidence of the witnesses will all",
                " stand doubtful, and none will be held",

                " element of doubt.",

                " jurists are also agreed that the forgiveness",
                " is related to the third Command, which",

                " some traditions, after enforcing the punishment, Hadrat",
                " `Umar said to Abu Bakrah and his",
                " two companions: \"If you repent (or confess",
                " your lie), I shall accept your evidence",

                " but not Abu Bakrah. On the face",
                " of it, it appears to be a",
                " strong argument. But from the details given",
                " above of Mughirah bin Shu`bah's case, it",
                " would become obvious that it is not",
                " correct to cite this precedent in support",
                " of this view. For in that case,",
                " there was complete unanimity as far as",
                " the act (of sexual intercourse) was concerned",
                " and Mughirah bin Shu`bah himself did not",
                " deny it. The point of dispute was",
                " the identity of the woman. Mughirah said",
                " that she was his own wife, whom",
                " the accusers had mistaken for Umm Jamil.",
                " Then it had also been established that",
                " the wife of Hadrat Mughirah and Umm",
                " Jamil resembled with each other to a",
                " degree that from the distance and in",
                " the kind of light that they were",
                " seen, the former could Be mistaken for",
                " the latter. But the circumstantial evidence was",
                " wholly in favour of Mughirah bin Shu'bah,",
                " and a witness of the case also",
                " had admitted that the woman was not",
                " clearly visible. That is why Hadrat `Umar",
                " decided the case in favour of Mughirah",
                " bin Shu`bah, and after punishing Abu Bakrah,",
                " said the words as mentioned in the",
                " above-quoted traditions. This clearly shows that the",
                " real intention of Hadrat 'Umar was to",
                " impress on the accusers that they should",
                " confess that they had given way to",
                " undue suspicion and that they should repent",

                " such suspicions in future, otherwise their evidence",
                " would never be accepted. From this it",
                " cannot be concluded that in the eyes",
                " of Hadrat 'Umar the evidence of a",
                " person whose falsehood had been established, could",
                " become acceptable just after he had repented.",
                " The truth is that in this matter",
                " the view of the former group is",
                " more sound. None except AIIah can know",
                " whether a person has repented sincerely or",

                " him in future simply because he has",
                " uttered repentance. Moreover, the words in the",
                " Text themselves indicate that except those who",

                " Command also? Qazf after aII is a",
                " sort of defamation. Why should not a",
                " person who confesses his guilt, apologizes and",
                " repents, be let off, when Allah Himself",
                " says: \"... except those who repent and",

                " Allah forgives while the people do not",
                " forgive. The answer is that the act",

                " the word Taubah with the tongue; it",

                " to demand it in a court of",

                "(4) There is a difference of opinion",

                " only by free Muslim spouses, who should",
                " not have been convicted of qazf previously.",
                " If both husband and wife are nonMuslim,",

                " found guilty of an illicit or doubtful",
                " relationship with another man, exercise of li",
                " `an will not be valid. The Hanafis",
                " have imposed these conditions, because according to",
                " them, there is no other difference between",
                " li `an and qazf than this: -the",
                " other man commits qazf, he is given",
                " the prescribed punishment, but if the husband",
                " himself commits it, he can escape the",

                " other respects, li `an and qazf are",
                " identical. Moreover, since according to the Hanafis,",
                " the oaths of li an are in",
                " the nature of evidence, they do not",
                " concede this right to a person who",
                " is not legally fit to give evidence.",
                " But the truth is that in this",
                " matter the position of the Hanafis is",
                " weak, and the opinion of Imam Shafi`i",
                " is correct, because the Qur'an has not",
                " made the accusation of the wife a",
                " component part of the verse of qazf,",
                " but has prescribed a separate law for",
                " it. Therefore, it cannot be linked with",
                " the law of qazf and treated under",
                " the conditions prescribed for qazf. Then, the",
                " wording of the verse of li'an is",
                " different from the wording of the verse",
                " of qazf and the two lay down",
                " separate injunctions. Therefore, the law of li",
                " `an should be derived from the verse",
                " of li `an and not from the",
                " verse of qazf. For instance, according to",
                " the verse of qazf, the person who",
                " accuses chaste women (muhsanat) of zina, deserves",
                " to be punished. But in the verse",
                " of li `an, there is no condition",
                " of the chastity of the wife. A",
                " woman might have committed sins in life,",
                " but if she repents later on and",
                " marries somebody, the husband is not authorised",
                " by the verse of li `an to",
                " accuse her unjustly whenever he likes, and",
                " to deny fatherhood of her children simply",
                " because she had once lived in sin.",
                " The other equally important reason is that",
                " there is a world of difference between",
                " accusing a wife and accusing the other",
                " woman. The law cannot treat the two",
                " alike. A man has nothing to do",
                " with the other woman. He is neither",
                " attached to her emotionally, nor his honour,",
                " his family relations and rights are at",
                " stake nor his lineage. The only meaningful",
                " interest he can have in the woman's",
                " character can be his desire to see",
                " a morally pure and clean society. Contrary",
                " to this, his relationship with his wife",
                " is deep and of varied nature. She",
                " is the custodian of the purity of",
                " his race, of his property and his",
                " house; she is his life partner, sharer",
                " of his secrets, and with her he",
                " is attached in most delicate and deep",
                " feelings. If she is morally corrupt, it",
                " will deal a serious blow to his",
                " honour, his interests and his progeny. These",
                " two things, therefore, cannot be considered alike,",
                " and the law cannot treat them as",
                " equal to each other. Is an evil",
                " affair of the wife of a zimmi,",
                " or a slave, or a convicted husband",

                " suspicion, but only when the husband accuses",
                " his wife clearly of zina, or denies",
                " in plain words that the child is",
                " his. Imam Malik and Laith bin Sa`d",

                " they could only earn through prostitution. The",

                " no other object of imposing a heavy",
                " demand on the poor slave girl, especially",
                " when it was much higher than the",
                " usual wages for work or labour. Secondly,",
                " beautiful and young slave girls were made",
                " to stay in the brothel and a",
                " flag was put at the door to",
                " indicate that a \"needy person\" could satisfy",
                " his lust there. Such women were called",
                " \"qaliqiyat\" and their houses were well known",

                " says: \"The Prophet of Allah prohibited us",
                " from accepting anything from the earnings of",
                " a slave girl except that which she",
                " earned through manual labour, such as (and",
