                " pagan husbands remained in the abode of",
                " disbelief. Likewise, many Muslim men emigrated and",
                " their pagan wives were left in the",

                " on the authority of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin",
                " 'Amr bin `As. In this second tradition",

                " the legal effect of the separation of",

                " authenticity of Ibn `Abbas's tradition, it contradicts",
                " their own viewpoint. For, according to their",

                " the marriage continues to be valid, otherwise",
                " it dissolves automatically as soon as the",
                " third menstrual course starts. But in the",
